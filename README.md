## About
Design implementation of the RISC-V Base 32 Integer core in Verilog HDL. This is a 5-stage pipeline processor core and supports the Zicsr (Control Status Registers) extension. This is RISC-V compliant and passed `rv32ui` (RV32 User-Mode Integer-Only) and `rv32mi` (RV32 Machine-Mode Integer-Only) [tests of RISC-V International.](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests) Formal verification via [SymbiYosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/sby) is also utilized to  test the pipeline design. Includes support for [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/).  

The RISC-V ISA implemented here is based on [Volume 1, Unprivileged Spec v. 20191213](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/tag/Ratified-IMAFDQC) and [Volume 2, Privileged Spec v. 20211203.](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/tag/Priv-v1.12)

## Pipeline Features
 - 5 pipelined stages  
 - Separate data and instruction memory interface **[Harvard architecture]**  
 - Load instructions take a minimum of 3 clk cycles plus any additional memory stalls   
 - Taken branch and jump instructions take a minimum of 3 clk cycles **[No Branch Prediction Used]**  
 - An instruction with data dependency to the next instruction that is a CSR write or Load instruction will take a minimum of 2 clk cycles **[Operand Forwarding used]**   
 - **All remaining instructions take a minimum of 1 clk cycle**   

## Supported Features of Zicsr Extension Module

## Regression Tests
The RISC-V toolchain `riscv64-unknown-elf-` and Modelsim executables `vsim` and `vlog` must be callable from PATH. If Modelsim executables are missing, the script will then call Icarus Verilog executables `iverilog` and `vvp` instead. Run **regression tests** inside `test/` directory either with:
 - `$ ./test.sh` = run regression tests for both `riscv-tests/isa/rv32ui/` and `riscv-tests/isa/rv32mi/`
 - `$ ./test.sh rv32ui` = run regression tests only for the `riscv-tests/isa/rv32ui/`
 - `$ ./test.sh rv32mi` = run regression tests only for the `riscv-tests/isa/rv32mi/`
 - `$ ./test.sh extra` =  run regression tests for `extra/` 
 - `$ ./test.sh all` = run regression tests for `riscv-tests/isa/rv32ui/`, `riscv-tests/isa/rv32mi/`, and `extra/`  
 - `$ ./test.sh compile` = compile-only the rtl files
 
 ## Run Individual Tests
 - `$ ./test.sh <testfile>` = test and debug testfile (without simulating) which is located at INDIVIDUAL_TESTDIR
 - `$ ./test.sh <testfile> -gui` = test and debug testfile and open wave in Icarus
 - `$ ./test.sh <testfile> -nosim` = compile and debug testfile without simulating it
Below is the expected output after running `$ ./test.sh`:

## Install Design to FPGA (CMOD S7 FPGA Board)
 - `$ ./test.sh <design> -install` = compile and install design (located at INDIVIDUAL_TESTDIR) to FPGA board
 - `$ ./test.sh freertos -install` = compile and install FreeRTOS progam to FPGA board

The application code for this project is in `test/freertos/freertos.c`. The schematic is presented below along with the mobile application to access the device via Bluetooth. The mobile app was developed using the [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/). The `apk` file is in  `test/freertos/mobile_app.apk`. The `aia` file for the mobile app is in `test/freertos/mobile_app.aia` which can be imported to MIT App Inventor for further customization.

## Paper Access
The title of the paper is `Design, Implementation, and Verification of a 32-bit RISC-V Processor with Real-Time Operating System and Regression Testing Framework`. As of this moment, the paper is still unpublished so I was refrained on linking the paper in this public repository. But I will post it here as soon as it is published (hopefully). But if you are still interested to have a look at the paper, you can chat me at [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelo-jacobo/) so we can talk about it. Below is the paper abstract:   

> RISC-V, an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), is gaining traction in various industries recently due to its open nature, straightforward design, modularity, and scalability. This paper presents the design, implementation, and verification of a 32-bit RISC-V processor with Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) support and a regression testing framework. The RISC-V core is designed using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) based on the classic five-stage pipeline architecture. A comprehensive regression test is then conducted to ensure the processor core's compliance with the RISC-V ISA specifications. Thereafter, FreeRTOS is then integrated into the core, enabling effective management of time-sensitive microcontroller applications and multitasking, proving its relevance in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Top-level peripherals and a custom software library are also integrated to enhance the core's versatility and user-friendliness. A real-world application, the "Smart Garden Assistant with Real-time Monitoring and Security," is then developed to demonstrate the functioning RISC-V core with RTOS capability. Finally, a design evaluation is conducted and a comparative analysis is then performed to assess the design implementation against previous studies. This study aims to contribute to the growing body of research on RISC-V processors, emphasizing their value in the emerging era of open-source and customizable processor architectures.
